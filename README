=========================================================================
The audio files (664 files, size ~1gb) can be downloaded from http://www.beatport.com/
using the bash script:

./audio_dl.sh

To download the files manually use links of the following form:
http://geo-samples.beatport.com/lofi/<name of mp3 file>
e.g.:
http://geo-samples.beatport.com/lofi/5377710.LOFI.mp3

To convert the audio files to .wav use (bash + sox):

./convert_audio.sh

To retrieve the genre information, the JSON contained within the website was parsed.
The tempo annotation was extracted from forum entries of people correcting the bpm values (i.e. manual annotation of tempo).
